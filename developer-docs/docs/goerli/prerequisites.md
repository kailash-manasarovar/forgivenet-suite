    The app you clone is currently set up for Goerli so it might be the best option for a quick demo.

You will need the following:

## IDE

Create a new project in your IDE of choice. For example:

* WebStorm.
* Sublime.
* VSCode.

## Node

Download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## MetaMask

Have a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/) account ready in Chrome or Firefox with some [Goerli test ETH](https://www.google.com/search?q=goerli+faucet) in it.
